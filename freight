# Freight NFS Migration Suite - Main Entry Point
# Simple bash wrapper that calls the Python freight module

# Get the directory where this script is located
SCRIPT_DIR="$(dirname "$(realpath "$0")")"

# Set PYTHONPATH to include the script directory so the freight module can be found
export PYTHONPATH="$SCRIPT_DIR:${PYTHONPATH:-}"

# Change to script directory to ensure relative imports work
cd "$SCRIPT_DIR"

# Call the Python module with all arguments passed through
exec python3 -m src.main "$@"
